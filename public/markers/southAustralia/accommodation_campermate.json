This is home to some amazing mosaic creations, local history, public toilets, children's playground & free BBQ's. \r\n\r\nBookings for the community Caravan Park are taken via the Cummins Takeaway & Deli, open 7 days & located at 62 Bruce Terrace.

The walk is moderate in difficulty and takes approximately 45 minutes to complete. Limestone steps have been installed along the track, making it accessible to some all-terrain wheelchairs.\n\nThe walk begins at the car park and winds up the side of the volcano, passing through native vegetation and offering glimpses of the crater below. Once at the top, visitors can enjoy panoramic views of Mount Gambier, the Blue Lake, and the surrounding countryside.\n\nThe Mount Schank Volcano Walk is a popular tourist destination and is also a popular spot for locals to enjoy a walk or picnic. The walk is open year-round, but it is best to avoid visiting on hot days as there is little shade along the track",

Hughes Walk is a short loop around historic Hughes Engine House and takes about one hour. Interpretive signs illustrate the geology of Moonta ore bodies and the mining methods used to work them. A trail brochure is available from the Moonta Tourist Office and the Moonta Mines Museum. It's a fascinating part of South Australia's mining history, and well worth a look.",

Boating, fishing, beachcombing, swimming, bird watching and nature walks are all popular activities. A variety of designated campgrounds in the park offer easy access to the beaches, bays and walking trails. Lincoln National Park overlooks Boston Bay, the largest natural harbour in Australia, with granite headlands, sheltered bays and scenic offshore islands. On the southern side of the park are the massive, wind-sculpted sand dunes of the Sleaford-Wanna dune system and the pounding surf of the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nMemory Cove itself is a magnificent and secluded bay with a pure white sandy beach, cradled between densely vegetated headlands. Memory Cove provides a very special camping or day-visit wilderness experience. Explorer Matthew Flinders named the area in honour of his crew who lost their lives while searching for water. When Flinders reached the area in 1802, fresh water supplies were so low that he sent eight of his crew off to search for more. They never returned. \r\n\r\nBooking is essential!",

It is very peaceful and not terribly popular. The road to the turnoff is dirt/rock and about 18km long, but well graded. There is no road noise but wind could be a factor, especially in poor weather.

A picnic shelter with several tables is provided on the top of the hill with scenic views down over the jetty. Fantastic fishing opportunities exist for beginners through to seasoned anglers. The 200 metre long jetty was built in 1913 to support the gypsum mining industry at Marion and Inneston Lakes. In its early days, 14 one-tonne horse drawn wagons ran along a wooden railway from Inneston Lake to the Stenhouse Bay Jetty, which was eventually replaced with steel tracks and trains. Gypsum was tipped from the wagons and trains down the hillside and loaded onto the large ships waiting at the jetty below 24 hour hours a day. Much of the stone infrastructure can still be seen at the base of the jetty and the old railway can be walked along what is now known as the Thomson-Pfitzner Plaster Trail Hike.\r\n\r\nInterpretive signs are in place along the trails for visitors to learn more about the history of the area. Park entry fees apply, which are payable online. Please refer to website for current pricing.",

The bricks are red in color and have never been rendered or painted, giving the lighthouse a very distinctive day mark.",

        "description": "Tailem Bend is located along the cliffs of the Murray River, about 99 kilometers east of Adelaide. The town was established with the arrival of the railway in 1887 and has since become a hub for pig farming, dairy production, and grain cultivation.\n\nThe Tailem Bend Football Club, situated on Granites Road, offers camping spots for $10 per vehicle per night. Visitors can contact the caretaker, Brian, to settle fees and discuss the duration of their stay (which is flexible). Brian also provides access to amenities like toilets, showers, and a BBQ upon request. Potable water is available, and pets are welcome on leads. During the football season, meals are served on Thursday and Saturday evenings.\n\nFor a step back in time, \"Old Tailem Town\" is a theme park showcasing the history of early settlers from 1860 to 1960. Adventurous visitors can also take part in the park's Ghost Tours held in the evenings.\n\nCost: $10 per vehicle per night. The town's financial records are kept at this location, so guests can drop receipts into the provided box.\n\nParking: Water is available, pets must be on leads, and there is access to toilets, showers, and a BBQ (contact Brian). No set time limit for stays. To reach the camping area, stay left towards the netball courts, with shaded sites under trees. Meals are available Thursday and Saturday evenings during the football season.",

Many migratory birds flock here at this time as they search for prime nesting sites and the lagoon comes alive!\n\nThe site is often visited by native wildlife such as wallabies, they love the fresh grass around the site and have been known to visit the campers in the camp kitchen on an evening. There are echidnas here too, if you are lucky you may see the rare albino echidna who frequents the site along with Kangaroos & Koalas to mention a few! ",
