On the popular sunset magic cruise, you'll explore the rugged northern end of Lake Argyle while navigating through some of the lake's 90 islands and inlets. The Skipper will entertain and inform with commentary on the natural history and development of Lake Argyle, The Ord River Irrigation System and the Aquaculture Industry. You'll encounter Rock Wallabies, Crocodiles, Wallaroos (Euros) and the diverse array of birdlife that call Lake Argyle home. \n\nYou'll be delighted and awed by the Archer Fish that shoot water up at your hand with amazing precision. You'll watch a Catfish feeding frenzy (also known by the fancier term of Silver Cobbler') and perhaps you'll even be enticed to come back out on one of our fishing trips. As the sun sinks behind the glorious Carr Boyd Ranges, you'll enjoy a complimentary drink and a light snack to make the most of this magic time of day. With rugged red cliffs reflecting into the blue water, Lake Argyle is the ultimate place to catch the last golden rays of the Kimberley sun. Includes: Complimentary afternoon tea and alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. Average Duration: 3.5 hours Note: We specialise in observing wildlife, but due to the nature of wild animals it cannot be guaranteed you will see all that is described in our services. Dress Code and what to bring: Dress 'Kimberley casual' - shorts, t-shirt and sandals. Don't forget your hat, sunscreen, camera, towel and swimwear. If you are sensitive to the cold, bring a light jacket to wear while we are motoring. Warm clothing may be required from June to August.\n\nLake Argyle Cruises offers a breathtaking adventure in the heart of Western Australia's Kimberley region. Nestled against the Ord River, Lake Argyle is Australia's largest man-made reservoir, surrounded by stunning landscapes and abundant wildlife.

The water is saltier than the ocean so people are more buoyant and float better. There is a toilet here and some interpretive information.",

These microorganisms produce carotenoids, which are pigments that give the lake its pink hue.\n\nLake Hillier is about 600 meters long and 250 meters wide. It is surrounded by a rim of sand and a dense woodland of paperbark and eucalyptus trees. The lake is located in a remote area of Middle Island, and the only way to see it is by boat or plane.",

The town is also home to a number of Aboriginal communities, who have lived in the area for thousands of years.\n\nOne of the most popular attractions in Beagle Bay is the Beagle Bay Cemetery, which is the final resting place of over 1,000 Japanese pearl divers who died in the region between 1912 and 1942. The cemetery is a moving reminder of the sacrifices made by these men, and it is a popular spot for visitors to pay their respects.\n\nAnother popular attraction in Beagle Bay is the Beagle Bay Rock Art. This ancient rock art is located on a cliff face overlooking the ocean, and it is believed to be over 10,000 years old. The rock art depicts a variety of animals and people, and it provides a fascinating glimpse into the lives of the Aboriginal people who lived in the area thousands of years ago.\n",

From Perth, you can get there in just 2 hours by joining the scenic Indian Ocean Drive at Yanchep.\n\nWhen the swell and sea breeze are up, you\u2019ll find top-notch conditions for windsurfing and surfing in Hangover Bay too. After good winter rains, the coast is coloured with clusters of pink and white banjine, yellow wattle and many other wildflower species.\n\nNature lovers may also spot Bottlenose dolphins, Sea lions, Emus, Kangaroos, Bobtail lizards, Gould\u2019s monitors and Carpet pythons (which are completely harmless).\n\nPicnic tables and gas barbecues make Hangover Bay the ideal spot for lunch or dinner by the ocean, or head into Cervantes to feast like a king on Western Australia\u2019s most valuable delicacy - the rock lobster.",

The Pinnacles were formed over 25,000 to 30,000 years ago, when the sea receded and left behind deposits of sea shells. Over time, these deposits hardened and were eroded by the wind and rain, forming the pinnacles that we see today.\n\nThe Pinnacles Desert is a popular tourist destination, and visitors can explore the area on foot, by bike, or by car. There are a number of walking trails that wind through the pinnacles, and visitors can also climb to the top of some of the tallest pinnacles for stunning views of the surrounding area.",

        "description": "Manning Gorge is one of the most beautiful and best swimming spots in the Kimberley.\n\nLocated on Manning Creek in the grounds of the 283,280ha Mt Barnett Station, water remains at the base of the waterfalls and in several pools along the creek year round, ideal for a refreshing dip. \nThe waterfalls are seasonal and fed by the rains during wet season, so they may be dry the mid to late dry season. \n\nWhen exploring, you may also come across some examples of Bradshaw and Wandjina rock art.\n\nVisiting the gorge involves an adventurous walk of approximately 3 kilometres to the top of the gorge, following the informal trail markers made up of rock cairns, red discs and arrows. The trail begins at the campground, where visitors must first cross Manning Creek to re-join the trail path on the other side. Visitors may swim the 100 metres across, or use the rope guide with floats to ferry belongings. \n\nThe trail follows a route overland rather than along the creek with views over the ranges and savannah woodlands along the way. The terrain is uneven, with some rock scrambling and an incline towards the end. The trail is mostly unshaded, so it is important to bring drinking water and to wear a hat. ",

        "description": "Greens Pool, located at the edge of William Bay National Park, is renowned for its striking granite boulders, crystal-clear turquoise waters, and pristine white sandy beach. These boulders create a natural barrier, shielding the pool from the powerful Southern Ocean.\n\nStunning year-round, Greens Pool is especially popular in summer, offering calm waters perfect for family-friendly activities. Visitors can swim, snorkel, or simply relax on the beach or atop the surrounding rocks with breathtaking views of the water.\n\nSnorkelers can explore the vibrant underwater landscape, home to an array of marine life. You might spot zebra fish, silver drummer, six-spined leatherjackets, and mosaic sea stars among the many fascinating creatures.\n\nDue to its popularity during peak seasons like school and public holidays, parking at William Bay National Park can be limited, so it's best to visit outside these times if possible. Note that camping is not allowed within the park.\n\nA short walk from Greens Pool takes you to Elephant Rocks, another must-see location ideal for swimming.",

        "description": "One of the most spectacular sites at DEntrecasteaux is Black Point, a massive outcrop of hexagonal basalt columns formed 135 million years ago by volcanic lava flow.\n\nBlack Point owes its unique appearance to the lava which flowed from the Darling Scarp and slowly cooled at the ocean. In the cooling process the lava cracked and shrunk, and close packed, hexagonal columns were formed perpendicular to the surface. These Stepping Stones  as they are known as are now slowly being eroded away by the Southern Ocean. To reach the black basalt columns that give Black Point its name, a short walk is required along the beach. In calm weather, you may be able to get close enough to the basalt pillars to hear the organ-like music they create as the waves and wind echo through their gaps.\n\nBlack Point is approximately 2 hours from Augusta and access is by 4WD only. Be sure to reduce your tyre pressure to suit the conditions once you reach the sandy section. Black Point Road is closed in winter due to the tracks becoming inundated.\n\nThere are 20 camp sites at Humpback Hollow and 10 at Seal Cove with basic facilities. Popular with fishers, surfers and sightseers, the sites operate on a first come, first serve basis. Camping fees apply.\n\nBlack Point long been known to local surfers, who have been coming here for years and helped popularise the site. Fishing from the rocks is also popular but it can be dangerous. \n\nNo dogs ",

The climb is challenging but rewarding, and the views from the top are simply stunning.\n\nDiamond Tree Lookout Manjimup provides a unique opportunity to gain a spectacular birds eye view across the treetops of the Karri forest near Manjimup. Not designed for the faint hearted, the gruelling 51-metre climb to the top of the world.",

The walk starts at the Longing, Memory, Sight artwork, which is a fragment of a letter sent by a soldier to his loved one. The walk then takes you through a series of 21 interpretive markers, each of which tells the story of a different ship in the first and second convoys. The lookout at the end of the walk offers stunning views of King George Sound, where the troops gathered on ships before departing for war. There is also a shelter at the lookout with interpretive material about the convoys. The walk is suitable for all ages and fitness levels. It is approximately 1.5 kilometres long and takes around 30 minutes to complete. The lookout is accessible by wheelchair.",

The ancient gorge has deep blue water, red limestone cliff faces and a wonderful array of birds and wildlife including the rare black-footed wallaby and red kangaroos. From the top, the views into the creek and out to the Ningaloo Reed are purely spectacular.\n\nThe 1.5 kilometre walk trail slowly climbs up the red rock cliffs over a flat path which then becomes harder as it narrows and requires navigation of rocks and small creek line gullies. The trail follows the gorge, becoming more difficult as you ascend the range, however, the views into the gorge are well worth the effort. From the top of the gorge walls, look out for the wide variety of birds and yellow-footed rock wallabies that inhabit the rock walls.\n\nAll activities start at the Yardie Creek car park where there are toilets and picnic areas.\n\nYardie Creek Gorge, located in Cape Range National Park, Western Australia, is a stunning geological formation characterized by sheer red limestone cliffs that rise majestically along the tranquil waterway. Visitors can enjoy scenic boat tours within the gorge, spot diverse birdlife, and explore hiking trails offering panoramic vistas. The gorge is also home to rock wallabies and provides picnicking facilities. Yardie Creek Gorge is a captivating destination within Cape Range National Park, offering a unique blend of natural beauty and outdoor experiences.",

There is a picnic table and some chairs but no other facilities. The camping surface is grass in the bush and a dirt surface next to the river. There is a dirt boat ramp so do not block it off. This spot is very popular with the local farmers and their speed/ski boats especially on weekends and in the holidays.\n ",

Replacing the original stone lighthouse, it stands impressively at 38 meters, ranking as Australia's fourth tallest lighthouse of its kind. This advanced structure introduced cutting-edge technology to the island, boasting a holophotal revolving light flashing every 20 seconds, greatly improving navigation for passing ships and reducing coral shore groundings. Initially powered by electricity in 1936, it achieved full automation in 1990. Today, with its powerful, far-reaching light spanning 26 nautical miles, the Wadjemup Lighthouse remains a vital guide for safe navigation towards Fremantle port.",

The Milky Way arcs overhead, and there's no sign of human presence.\n\nWhile remote, Lake Brown is a popular camping spot, especially along its western shore. A rocky granite ridge with caves, boulders, and bush offers an excellent vantage point of the lake and surrounding fields.

The rock faces and cliffs contrast beautifully against the blue water and white sand, reminding you of just how incredible these hidden beaches are.\n\nBlue Haven is one of the many beaches along the Great Ocean Drive, which twists and turns alongside the coastline offering fantastic views and building anticipation for that very first dip in Esperance\u2019s beaches.",

The tunnel is up to 20m high and 15m wide in some parts! 350 million years ago this was part of an ocean reef system.  \n\nThere is a Kimberley feel all-around. Sunlight arcs onto the cathedral-like cavern with a sense of mystery. Adding to the spectacle, large stalactite rock formations hang from the walls.  \n\nA deep history, as well as beauty exists here. It was used as a hideout late last century by the Aboriginal leader Jandamarra who was killed outside its entrance in 1897. \n\nTake a walk through the 750m tunnel which takes you from one side of the Napier Range to the other. Keep your eye out for the many bat species and freshwater crocodiles that live in the cave. The roof has collapsed through to the top of the range near the centre of the tunnel. Take a torch, wear sneakers and be prepared to get wet and possibly cold and always let someone know where you are. \n\nYou\u2019ll never forget a walk into the tunnel of surprises. It's Crocodile Dundee and Indiana Jones all in one spot!",

A myriad of fish, including over 70 species of finfish, and coral can be seen swimmingl through the tranquil waters and crawling along the ocean floor, making it a popular snorkelling location. Spot dart, moon wrasse, raccoon butteryfly fish, humbugs, western rock lobster and other crustaceans such as banded hair shrimp and beds of oysters, along with 10 types of sponge and 11 species of coral.\n\nWalk along the pristine sandy beach and examine rock pools along the shore. Swim in the sheltered waters and laze about on the soft sand. Then settle back after a rewarding investigation of the Blue Holes to see the beautiful Western Australian sunset.\n\nBlue Holes and Kalbarri are approximately 6 hours' drive north of Perth.\n\nThere are toilets onsite.",

Sit beneath it, and it feels as though you\u2019re in a natural spa. \n\nWhile it\u2019s most fun when the waves are crashing, the pool is still a beautiful spot to visit and take a dip when it\u2019s calm too.",

        "description": "he Marrinup Trail meanders through some of Australia's oldest rocks, which are more often exposed on this part of the Darling Scarp near Dwellingup, south of Perth. The mountain bike trail passes through native jarrah forest and redgum. The interesting 'Cage in the bush' Prisoner of War (POW) camp is located a short distance from the trail.\n\nProceeding clockwise, this easy to follow loop trail starts at the old Marrinup town site which was destroyed by bush fire in 1961. The 7.9 kilometre Top Trail has a single track suitable for both the novice and experienced rider. The trail can be shortened to about four kilometres by using the short course return route. It varies from narrow, challenging tracks with flat sections and hill climbs to true gravel roads, with the ball bearing like bauxite gravel making things pretty interesting for mountain biking.",

Take a walk through the displays and discover more about the marine turtles found along the Ningaloo Coast. Learn about their lifecycle, the threats they face and how to view mating and nesting turtles and turtle hatchlings in the natural environment.\n\nFrom December through to early March join a guided Turtle Eco-Education tour and scout for female turtles making their way on to the beach to lay their eggs. Towards the end of the season you may even be lucky enough to encounter turtle hatchlings as they emerge from their nest, making their way to the ocean to start their long journey to adulthood.\n\nGuided Turtle Eco-Education tours increase the chance of finding and observing nesting female turtles in the natural environment. Viewing nesting female turtles and hatchlings with a guide minimises your chance of disturbing them which will increase the chance of female turtles successfully laying eggs.",

        "description": "Venture inland from Carnarvon and step into Western Australia's rugged outback. Welcome to the Kennedy Range, a dramatic landscape shaped by ancient forces.\n\nThis vast sandstone plateau stretches between 12 and 25 km wide and 75 km long, rising 80 meters above the surrounding red earth plains. The range\u2019s geology tells a fascinating story, with rocks formed beneath an ancient sea. Keep an eye out for marine fossils embedded in the exposed rock.\n\nThe plateau\u2019s red sand dunes, shaped 20,000 years ago, are now covered with shrubland and spinifex grass. On the western side, spring-fed oases provide vital water for wildlife, especially in droughts, and hold cultural significance for the area\u2019s traditional owners.\n\nThe best way to explore this stunning landscape is on foot. Several trails lead you through the park\u2019s dramatic gorges, but be sure to check safety advice before setting out in this remote region.\n\nSpring is an ideal time to visit, when wildflowers like everlastings bloom, creating a striking contrast against the red earth. For stargazers, camping at Temple Gorge Campground offers breathtaking views of the night sky, where the vastness of the plateau seems small next to the infinite stars above. ",

Perhaps it is when the weather is stormy with crashing seas, perhaps it is when it is calm and sunny and the water is crystal clear. \n\nPerhaps the greatest sight is when the sun sets over the Indian Ocean and the colour of the rock changes every minute. If you wait long enough at sunset, you can even see the working Cape Naturaliste Lighthouse light up! ",

They include red-lip morwong, banded sweep, bullseyes, wrasse, schools of buffalo bream, sea mullet, tarwine and blowfish. Sand whiting and Australian herring can be seen in the open water.\n\nYou may also notice a few anemones growing within the pool, while cushion stars, abalone and other shellfish species hide in the rocky reef top. While the snorkelling inside the lagoon is easy, the surge can be strong on the outer edge of the reef. Beware of cobblers in the weed near the shore.",

During the permissible and license season, abalone fishing is also a popular activity for locals and visitors to Yanchep Lagoon and Fisherman\u2019s Hollow to the south. \n\nWhen abalone fishing, ensure you know catch limits, wear appropriate clothing, check the conditions on the day and swim with a friend. Although Yanchep Lagoon may appear safe, be aware of strong currents and waves washing over the reef when collecting abalone.\n\nPlease note that swimmers should swim between the flags and be cautious of the strong current which flows out of the lagoon into deeper water. If you are caught in a rip, stay calm, raise your hand and await rescue. Fishing is not permitted between the red and yellow flags and spearfishing is prohibited at all times.",
