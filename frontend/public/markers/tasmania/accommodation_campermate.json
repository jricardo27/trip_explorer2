        "description": "Eldee Camp Spot is just that, a camp spot, not a caravan park. We offer relaxed un-powered camping in a natural bush setting, but we are only a 5 min drive to the local shops of Dodges Ferry. The surf beach is only a 3 min drive away and the boat ramp is just a 7 min drive away and there is a great playground and barbecues at the boat ramp.\r\n\r\nThe toilet & shower block are now complete & include a separate wheelchair friendly toilet & shower. The camp kitchen has a cosy wood heater and lots of comfy couches. All you got to do is set up, kick back and relax!",

A shorter, well-maintained path starts from the upper parking area, equipped with picnic facilities. A longer, less groomed route begins at the lower parking area, offering fewer amenities. Both paths take you through captivating rainforests. \n\nYour journey unfolds with four prominent cascades: Alexandra Falls, Hopetoun Falls, Albert Falls, and Victoria Falls, fondly known as \"Liffey Falls.\" Along the way, strategically placed viewing platforms offer perfect vantage points for capturing the falls' splendor with your camera.",

A part-boardwalk track takes you through beautiful mossy rainforest. In late summer you may catch the superbly fragrant scent of leatherwood flowers. The climax of the short loop track is when you come to the banks of the Franklin River. This wild river was once famous for the controversial dam that would have drowned much of its course. It was saved, and is now a tranquil place to take in the beauty of the wild. The Franklin is one of the best known of the many rivers that run through the Wild Rivers National Park. This walk along the banks of the Franklin and through an example of the cool temperate rainforest that is widespread throughout the park will give you an idea of the beauty that lies within the heart of this wild river wilderness. Along the walk you will find interpretation signs that detail some of the many values of this magnificent region.",

Boardwalks and viewing platforms let you observe short-tailed shearwaters and little penguins (also known as fairy penguins). You'll see these remarkable birds returning to their burrows in the sand dunes at dusk - little penguins making their way up the beach in tight groups and the shearwaters gliding in from the sea. The best viewing period is during the warmer months of September to February. There's also a campground just 20 metres from the beach with car parking, picnic facilities and toilets.",

It was formed by the erosion of the sea over millions of years. Devils Kitchen is a deep trench located near Tasman Arch. It is thought to have been formed by the collapse of a sea cave. The trench is about 60 metres deep and 30 metres wide. The waves crashing against the cliffs create a powerful whirlpool, hence the name \"Devils Kitchen\". Both Tasman Arch and Devils Kitchen are popular tourist destinations. There are viewing platforms at both locations where you can get a close-up view of these natural wonders.\n\nThe Tasman Arch & Devils Kitchen Lookout is a short walk from the car park. The walk is mostly flat and paved, making it accessible for people of all abilities. There are also toilets and picnic tables at the lookout.",

It is a popular tourist destination and can be accessed via a short 20-minute walk through the forest. The falls are best viewed from the viewing platform at the end of the trail, which offers stunning panoramic views of the waterfall and the surrounding forest.\n\nThe falls are fed by Wilsons Creek, which is a tributary of the Macquarie River. The water flow at the falls is regulated by a hydroelectric power station located upstream. However, even during times of low water flow, the falls are still a beautiful sight to behold.\n\nThe surrounding forest is home to a variety of native plants and animals, including ferns, mosses, and birds. The area is also a popular spot for bushwalking and camping.\n\nIf you are looking for a beautiful and easy-to-reach waterfall in Tasmania, Tarraleah Falls is a great option. The falls are a short drive from the main road between Hobart and the west coast, and the walk to the falls is relatively flat and easy.\n\nHere are some additional details about Tarraleah Falls:\n\nThe falls are located at the end of Wilsons Creek Road in Tarraleah.\nThe viewing platform is wheelchair accessible.\nThe falls are open year-round, but the best time to visit is during the spring or fall when the water levels are high.\nThere is a small car park at the trailhead.",

The hike to Wineglass Bay beach from the National Park car park takes approximately two hours round-trip, depending on your walking speed. The first part of the trail, which leads to the lookout, involves a challenging 1.3 km ascent but offers a rewarding view at the top. \n\nFrom the lookout, the path continues downhill through a bush trail lined with eucalypt trees, leading to the beach. A moderate level of fitness is required, and it's recommended to wear sturdy walking shoes or boots, dress for the weather, and bring enough water and snacks. Be sure to check the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service website for up-to-date details before you begin your hike.",
